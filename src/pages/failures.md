# My Failures

This is a list of my failures as a developer, ordered from latest to oldest.

## 9. The ERP Contract

For my second custom software opportunity, I was tasked with presenting a proposal for a custom ERP for a factory. I outlined the development timeline, functionalities, and pricing. However, the factory director was not convinced, and I feel my presentation lacked the impact needed to secure their confidence. Ultimately, they chose to go with an off-the-shelf ERP provider.

## 8. Cold Calling for my SaaS

After completing the second version of my SaaS, IglesiasBC, I began a cold outreach campaign targeting local churches. My plan was to demonstrate the platform's value and offer a full year of service for free in exchange for feedback. Despite numerous calls and messages, I failed to generate any interest. I eventually quit to focus on other priorities.

## 7. The Coding Bootcamp

Feeling confident in my development skills, I decided to launch a coding bootcamp. My goal was twofold: to share my knowledge and to improve my own soft skills through teaching. I invested significant time in research, curriculum planning, creating a landing page and promotional materials, and running Facebook ads. Despite weeks of effort and high hopes, I received 0 calls.

## 6. Networking at an Odoo Conference

When I saw a Facebook ad for a free Odoo conference in my town, I thought it would be a great networking opportunity to meet other developers or even find potential clients. I went, despite being quite nervous. After several hours, I realized the audience consisted primarily of potential clients whose needs were far beyond my scope, and there were no other developers to connect with. The event turned out to be a two-hour sales pitch from a competitor (Odoo), and I left feeling like I had wasted my time.

## 5. The Custom Jersey Builder

I partnered on a project to build a web-based sportswear designer. The tool would allow users to select colors and patterns and see a real-time preview of their custom jersey. The project was initiated for a specific set of clients. However, after several months of development, progress stalled, and we ultimately never finished it, leaving behind a promising concept and months of work.

## 4. The First Version of IglesiasBC

My first SaaS project, IglesiasBC, was intended to be an easy-to-use website builder specifically for churches. I believed it was a solid idea, but after discussing it with friends and potential users, I realized I was competing with established platforms like Wix, which could serve the same purpose. I abandoned the project because it lacked a unique value proposition. In retrospect, the UI was poor, and the codebase was bad.

## 3. Developing a Functional ERP

In my first role as the IT guy at a factory, I attempted to build a custom ERP from scratch. I spent weeks on the first version and learned a lot in the process. However, as my knowledge grew, I realized the initial codebase was horrible, and I deleted the entire project. I started over, but after several more months of development on the second version, I came to the same conclusion: my improved skills revealed that the new code was still very bad. But after trying for almost a year, i finally developed something great.

## 2. A Freelancing False Start

Since my web desing business didn't work, I shifted my focus to freelancing platforms, hoping to offer a broader range of services. I spent weeks researching and preparing my profile, only to discover that these platforms had strict age verification policies that prevented me, as a teenager, from working. So i decided to continue after i turned 18.

## 1. Selling Websites to Cafes and Photographers

As a 16-year-old beginner, I was trying to monetize my new skills. Since a traditional job wasn't an option, I decided to sell websites as a freelancer. I created a Facebook page, ran ads, and sent numerous cold outreach messages. After a couple of months and over 100 attempts, I landed my first client, a photographer. I received an initial payment of $50 and began work. Unfortunately, when the project was about halfway complete, the client ghosted me. So I quit.
